```{r}
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

```

## Problem 1

```{r}
homicides_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved")
    ) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "TulsaAL")
```

#### Describe the data

This dataset consists of 52178 observations and 14 variables a tidying it up. Each row of the data is a reported homicide case, including record of the victimâ€™s name, race/ethnicity, age, sex, location of the crime, and whether the crime was solved.


#### Resolution of each City
```{r}
homicides_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
    n = n()) 
```

#### Baltimore
```{r}
baltimore_df = 
  homicides_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "BaltimoreMD")

baltimore_summary = baltimore_df %>% 
  summarize(
    unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
    n = n())

balimtore_test = 
  prop.test(x = baltimore_summary %>% pull(unsolved), 
            n = baltimore_summary %>% pull(n))

balimtore_test %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

####For all Cities

Function
```{r}
prop_test_function = function(city_df) {
  city_summary = 
    city_df %>% 
    summarize(
      unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"),
      n = n()
    )
  
  city_test = 
    prop.test(x = city_summary %>% pull(unsolved), 
            n = city_summary %>% pull(n))
  
  return(city_test)
}
```

Use the function and iterate across all cities

```{r}
results_df = 
  homicides_df %>% 
  nest(data = uid:resolution) %>% 
  mutate(
    test_results = map(data, prop_test_function),
    tidy_results = map(test_results, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, tidy_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, starts_with("conf"))

results_df
```


#### plot

```{r}
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.2, hjust = 1))
```
